Reference culture:
	In order to find enough pearl oysters, free-divers were often forced to descend to depths of over 100 feet on a single breath, exposing them to the dangers of hostile creatures, waves, eye damage, and drowning, often as a result of shallow water blackout on resurfacing.
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_hunting
	Underwater diving was practised in ancient cultures to reclaim sunken valuables, and to help aid military campaigns.

	â€º to look further than what is obvious:
	If you scratch beneath the surface you'll find she's really a very nice person.

	Scratch underneath thAnnotatee surface, where does your purpose lie?
	It seems our will is worthless, like we're pawns beneath the sky
